# Targets

```{attention}
WORK IN PROGRESS
- include content from links below,
- explain neutrality-goal of adjacent HW (msp, switch, translators)
- show how GPIO is routed (simplified from schematic).
```

```{note}
Shepherd Nova has a second (unused) target-port on each observer and is looking for ideas.
